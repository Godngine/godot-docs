"Managing input is usually complex, no matter the OS or platform. To ease "
"this a little, a special built-in type is provided, :ref:`InputEvent "
"<class_InputEvent>`. This datatype can be configured to contain several "
"types of input events. Input Events travel through the engine and can be "
"received in multiple locations, depending on the purpose."

"Every input event is originated from the user/player (though it's "
"possible to generate an InputEvent and feed them back to the engine, "
"which is useful for gestures). The OS object for each platform will read "
"events from the device, then feed them to MainLoop. As :ref:`SceneTree "
"<class_SceneTree>` is the default MainLoop implementation, events are fed"
" to it. Godot provides a function to get the current SceneTree object : "
"**get_tree()**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/inputs/inputevent.rst:26
msgid ""
"But SceneTree does not know what to do with the event, so it will give it"
" to the viewports, starting by the \"root\" :ref:`Viewport "
"<class_Viewport>` (the first node of the scene tree). Viewport does quite"
" a lot of stuff with the received input, in order:"

"First of all, the standard :ref:`Node._input() <class_Node__input>`) "
"function will be called in any node that overrides it (and hasn't "
"disabled input processing with :ref:`Node.set_process_input() "
"<class_Node_set_process_input>`). If any function consumes the event, it "
"can call :ref:`SceneTree.set_input_as_handled() "
"<class_SceneTree_set_input_as_handled>`, and the event will not spread "
"any more. This ensures that you can filter all events of interest, even "
"before the GUI. For gameplay input, :ref:`Node._unhandled_input() "
"<class_Node__unhandled_input>`) is generally a better fit, because it "
"allows the GUI to intercept the events."

"Second, it will try to feed the input to the GUI, and see if any control "
"can receive it. If so, the :ref:`Control <class_Control>` will be called "
"via the virtual function :ref:`Control._gui_input() "
"<class_Control__gui_input>` and the signal \"input_event\" will be "
"emitted (this function is re-implementable by script by inheriting from "
"it). If the control wants to \"consume\" the event, it will call "
":ref:`Control.accept_event() <class_Control_accept_event>` and the event "
"will not spread any more. Events that are not consumed will propagate  "
"**up**, to :ref:`Control <class_Control>`'s ancestors. Use "
":ref:`Control.mouse_filter <class_Control_mouse_filter>` property to "
"control whether a :ref:`Control <class_Control>` is notified of mouse "
"events via :ref:`Control._gui_input() <class_Control__gui_input>` "
"callback, and whether these events are propagated further."

"If so far no one consumed the event, the unhandled input callback will be"
" called if overridden (and not disabled with "
":ref:`Node.set_process_unhandled_input() "
"<class_Node_set_process_unhandled_input>`). If any function consumes the "
"event, it can call :ref:`SceneTree.set_input_as_handled() "
"<class_SceneTree_set_input_as_handled>`, and the event will not spread "
"any more. The unhandled input callback is ideal for full-screen gameplay "
"events, so they are not received when a GUI is active."

"If no one wanted the event so far, and a :ref:`Camera <class_Camera>` is "
"assigned to the Viewport, a ray to the physics world (in the ray "
"direction from the click) will be cast. If this ray hits an object, it "
"will call the :ref:`CollisionObject._input_event() "
"<class_CollisionObject__input_event>` function in the relevant physics "
"object (bodies receive this callback by default, but areas do not. This "
"can be configured through :ref:`Area <class_Area>` properties)."
