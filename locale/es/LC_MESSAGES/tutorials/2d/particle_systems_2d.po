"The idea is that a \"particle\" is emitted at a fixed interval and with a"
" fixed lifetime. During its lifetime, every particle will have the same "
"base behavior. What makes every particle different and provides a more "
"organic look is the \"randomness\" associated to each parameter. In "
"essence, creating a particle system means setting base physics parameters"
" and then adding randomness to them."
