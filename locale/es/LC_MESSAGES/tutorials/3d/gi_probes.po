"Just like with :ref:`doc_reflection_probes`, and as stated in the "
":ref:`doc_spatial_material`, objects can show reflected or diffuse light."
" GI Probes are similar to Reflection Probes, but they use a different and"
" more complex technique to produce indirect light and reflections."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/gi_probes.rst:12
msgid ""
"The strength of GI Probes are real-time, high quality, indirect light. "
"While the scene needs a quick pre-bake for the static objects that will "
"be used, lights can be added, changed or removed and this will be updated"
" in real-time. Dynamic objects that move within one of these probes will "
"also receive indirect lighting from the scene automatically."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/gi_probes.rst:16
msgid ""
"Just like with ReflectionProbe, GIProbes can be blended (in a bit more "
"limited way), so it is possible to provide full real-time lighting for a "
"stage without having to resort to lightmaps."

msgid "The main downside of GIProbes are:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/gi_probes.rst:21
msgid ""
"A small amount of light leaking can occur if the level is not carefully "
"designed. this must be artist-tweaked."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/gi_probes.rst:22
msgid ""
"Performance requirements are higher than for lightmaps, so it may not run"
" properly in low end integrated GPUs (may need to reduce resolution)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/gi_probes.rst:23
msgid ""
"Reflections are voxelized, so they don't look as sharp as with "
"ReflectionProbe, but in exchange they are volumetric so any room size or "
"shape works for them. Mixing them with Screen Space Reflection also works"
" very well."

"They consume considerably more video memory than Reflection Probes, so "
"they must be used by care in the right subdivision sizes."

"Just like a ReflectionProbe, simply set up the GIProbe by wrapping it "
"around the geometry that will be affected."

"Afterwards, make sure to enable the geometry will be baked. This is "

"Unless there are materials with emission, GIProbe does nothing by "

"In some situations, though, indirect light may be too weak. Lights have "
"an indirect multiplier to tweak this:"

"For materials with high metalness and low roughness, it's possible to "

"detail than Reflection Probes or Screen Space Reflections, but fully "
"reflect volumetrically."

"GIProbes can easily be mixed with Reflection Probes and Screen Space "

#: ../../tutorials/3d/gi_probes.rst:92
msgid ""
"**Subdiv** Subdivision used for the probe. The default (128) is generally"

"**Energy** Multiplier for all the probe. Can be used to make the indirect"

"**Bias** Value used to avoid self-occlusion when doing voxel cone "
