"Normally, an artist does all the 3D modelling, then all the texturing, "
"looks at their awesome looking model in the 3D DCC and says \"looks "
"fantastic, ready for integration!\" then goes into the game, lighting is "
"setup and the game runs."

"So where does all this HDR stuff thing come from? The idea is that "
"instead of dealing with colors that go from black to white (0 to 1), we "
"use colors whiter than white (for example, 0 to 8 times white)."

"To be more practical, imagine that in a regular scene, the intensity of a"
" light (generally 1.0) is set to 5.0. The whole scene will turn very "

"After this the luminance of the scene is computed by averaging the "
"luminance of every pixel of it, and this value is used to bring the scene"
" back to normal ranges. This last operation is called tone-mapping. "
"Finally, we are at a similar place from where we started:"

"Except the scene is more contrasted, because there is a higher light "
"range in play. What is this all useful for? The idea is that the scene "
"luminance will change while you move through the world, allowing "
"situations like this to happen:"

"Additionally, it is possible to set a threshold value to send to the glow"

"The problem with this technique is that computer monitors apply a gamma "

"The mathematics of HDR require that we multiply the scene by different "

"This is the most compatible way of using linear-space assets and it will "
"work everywhere including all mobile devices. The main issue with this is"
" loss of quality, as sRGB exists to avoid this same problem. Using 8 bits"
" per channel to represent linear colors is inefficient from the point of "
"view of the human eye. These textures might be later compressed too, "
"which makes the problem worse."

"This is the most correct way to use assets in linear-space, as the "
"texture sampler on the GPU will do the conversion after reading the texel"
