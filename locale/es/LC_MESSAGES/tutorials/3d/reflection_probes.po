msgid ""
"As stated in the :ref:`doc_spatial_material`, objects can show reflected "
"or diffuse light. Reflection Probes are used as a source of reflected and"
" ambient light for objects inside their area of influence."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/reflection_probes.rst:12
msgid ""
"A probe of this type captures the surroundings (as a sort of 360 degrees "
"image), and stores versions of it with increasing levels of *blur*. This "
"is used to simulate roughness in materials, as well as ambient lighting."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/reflection_probes.rst:15
msgid ""
"While these probes are a very efficient way of storing reflections, they "
"have a few shortcomings:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/reflection_probes.rst:17
msgid ""
"They are efficient to render, but expensive to compute. This leads to a "
"default behavior where they only capture on scene load."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/reflection_probes.rst:18
msgid ""
"They work best for rectangular shaped rooms or places, otherwise the "
"reflections shown are not as faithful (specially when roughness is 0)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Setting Up"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/reflection_probes.rst:23
msgid ""
"Setting up reflection probes is really easy! Just create a "
"ReflectionProbe node, and wrap it around the area where you want to have "
"reflections:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/reflection_probes.rst:27
msgid ""
"This should result in immediate local reflections. If you are using a Sky"
" texture, reflections are by default blended. with it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/reflection_probes.rst:29
msgid ""
"By default, on interiors, reflections may appear to not have much "
"consistence. In this scenario, make sure to tick the *\"Box Correct\"* "
"property."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/reflection_probes.rst:34
msgid ""
"This setting changes the reflection from an infinite skybox to reflecting"
" a box the size of the probe:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/reflection_probes.rst:38
msgid ""
"Adjusting the box walls may help improve the reflection a bit, but it "
"will always look the best in box shaped rooms."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/reflection_probes.rst:40
msgid ""
"The probe captures the surrounding from the center of the gizmo. If, for "
"some reason, the room shape or contents occlude the center, it can be "
"displaced to an empty place by moving the handles in the center:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/reflection_probes.rst:45
msgid ""
"By default, shadow mapping is disabled when rendering probes (only in the"
" rendered image inside the probe, not the actual scene). This is a simple"
" way to save on performance and memory. If you really want shadows in the"
" probe, they can be toggled on/of with the *Enable Shadow* setting:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/reflection_probes.rst:50
msgid ""
"Finally, keep in mind that you may not want the Reflection Probe to "
"render some objects. A typical scenario is an enemy inside the room which"
" will move around. To keep objects from being rendered in the "
"reflections, use the *Cull Mask* setting:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Interior vs Exterior"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/reflection_probes.rst:58
msgid ""
"If you are using reflection probes in an interior setting, it is "
"recommended that the **Interior** property is enabled. This makes the "
"probe not render the sky, and also allows custom amibent lighting "
"settings."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/reflection_probes.rst:63
msgid ""
"When probes are set to **Interior**, custom constant ambient lighting can"
" be specified per probe. Just choose a color and an energy."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/reflection_probes.rst:65
msgid ""
"Optionally, you can blend this ambient light with the probe diffuse "
"capture by tweaking the **Ambient Contribution** property (0.0 means, "
"pure ambient color, while 1.0 means pure diffuse capture)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Blending"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/reflection_probes.rst:71
msgid ""
"Multiple reflection probes can be used and Godot will blend them where "
"they overlap using a smart algorithm:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/reflection_probes.rst:75
msgid ""
"As you can see, this blending is never perfect (after all, these are box "
"reflections, not real reflections), but these arctifacts are only visible"
" when using perfectly mirrored reflections. Normally, scenes have normal "
"mapping and varying levels of roughness which can hide this."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/reflection_probes.rst:79
msgid ""
"Alternatively, Reflection Probes work very well blended together with "
"Screen Space Reflections to solve these problems. Combining them makes "
"local reflections appear more faithful, while probes only used as "
"fallback when no screen-sace information is found:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/reflection_probes.rst:84
msgid ""
"Finally, blending interior and exterior probes is a recommended approach "
"when making levels that combine both interiors and exteriors. Near the "
"door, a probe can be marked as *exterior* (so it will get sky "
"reflections), while on the inside it can be interior."

msgid "Reflection Atlas"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/reflection_probes.rst:90
msgid ""
"In the current renderer implementation, all probes are the same size and "
"they are fit into a Reflection Atlas. The size and amount of probes can "
"be customized in Project Settings -> Quality -> Reflections"
