":ref:`Gridmaps <class_GridMap>` are a simple and fast way to create 3D "
"game levels. Think of it as a 3D version of the "
":ref:`TileMap<doc_using_tilemaps>` node. Similarly, you start with a "
"predefined library of 3D meshes that can be put on a grid, just like if "
"you were building a level with an unlimited amount of Lego blocks."

"Collisions can also be added to the meshes, just like you would do with "

"To assign a :ref:`class_CollisionShape` and :ref:`class_PhysicsBody` to "
"the meshes, the simplest way is to do it while creating the MeshLibrary. "
"Alternatively, you can also edit an existing MeshLibrary from within the "
"GridMap inspector, but only CollisionShapes can be defined there and not "
"PhysicsBody."

"To give the meshes a CollisionShape, you simply add children nodes to the"
