"A plugin is a great way to extend the editor with useful tools. It can be"
" made entirely with GDScript and standard scenes, without even reloading "
"the editor. Unlike modules, you don't need to create C++ code nor "
"recompile the engine. While this makes plugins not as powerful, there's "
"still a lot of things you can do with them. Note that a plugin is not "
"different from any scene you already can make, except that it is made via"
" script to add functionality."

"This tutorial will guide you through the creation of two simple plugins "
"so you can understand how they work and be able to develop your own. The "
"first will be a custom node that you can add to any scene in the project "
"and the other will be a custom dock added to the editor."

"The first thing you need to do is to create a new plugin that the editor "

"Plugins have a standard path like ``addons/plugin_name`` inside the "

"To make the ``plugin.cfg`` file, open your favorite text editor with a "
"blank file. Godot is not able (yet) to open text files besides scripts, "
"so this must be done in an external editor. Add the following structure "

"This is a simple ``ini`` file with metadata about your plugin. You need "
"to set up the name and description so users can understand what it does. "
"Add your own name so you can be properly credited. A version number is "
"useful so users can see if they have an outdated version (if you are "
"unsure on how to come up with the version number, check `SemVer "
"<http://semver.org/>`_). And finally a main script file to load when your"
" plugin is active."

"Open the script editor (F3) and create a new GDScript file called "

"It's important to deal with initialization and clean-up of resources. So "
"a good practice is to use the virtual function :ref:`_enter_tree() "
"<class_Node__enter_tree>` to initialize your plugin and "
":ref:`_exit_tree() <class_Node__exit_tree>` to clean it up. You can "

"Sometimes you want a certain behavior in many nodes. Maybe a custom scene"
" or control that can be reused. Instancing is helpful in a lot of cases "
"but sometimes it can be cumbersome, especially if you're using it between"
" many projects. A good solution to this is to make a plugin that adds a "
"node with a custom behavior."

"To create a new node type, you can avail of the function "
":ref:`add_custom_type() <class_EditorPlugin_add_custom_type>` from the "
":ref:`class_EditorPlugin` class. This function can add new types to the "
"editor, be it nodes or resources. But before you can create the type you "
"need a script that will act as the logic for the type. While such script "
"doesn't need to have the ``tool`` keyword, it is interesting to use it so"
" the user can see it acting on the editor."

"For this tutorial, we'll create a simple button that prints a message "
