"Beginning Godot 3.0, the audio engine has been rewritten from scratch. "
"The aim now is to present an interface much friendlier to sound design "
"professionals. To achieve this, the audio engine contains a virtual rack "
"where unlimited audio buses can be created and, on each of it, unlimited "
"amount of effect processors can be added (or more like, as long as your "
"CPU holds up!)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:16
msgid ""
"The implementation in Godot is pretty efficient and has been written "
"entirely from the ground up, without relying on any existing audio "
"libraries."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:19
msgid ""
"Even the effect processors were written exclusively for Godot (save for "
"the pitch shifting library), with games in mind. This allows a very "
"efficient tradeoff between performance and sound quality."

msgid "Decibel Scale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:26
msgid ""
"The new audio engine works primarily using the decibel scale. We have "
"chosen this over linear representation of amplitude because it's more "
"intuitive for audio professionals."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:30
msgid "For those unfamiliar with it, it can be explained with a few facts:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:32
msgid ""
"The decibel (dB) scale is a relative scale. It represents the ratio of "
"sound power by using 10 times the base 10 logarithm of the ratio "
"(10Ã—log\\ :sub:`10`\\ (P/P\\ :sub:`0`\\ ))."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:33
msgid ""
"For every 3dB, sound doubles or halves. 6dB represents a factor 4, 9dB a "
"factor 8, 10dB a factor 10, 20dB a factor 100, etc."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:34
msgid "Since the scale is logarithmic, true zero (no audio) can't be represented."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:35
msgid ""
"0dB is considered the maximum audible volume without *clipping*. This "
"limit is not the human limit but a limit from the sound hardware. Your "
"sound output simply can't output any sound louder than 0dB without "
"distorting it (clipping it)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:36
msgid ""
"Because of the above, your sound mix should work in a way where the sound"
" output of the *Master Bus* (more on that later), should never be above "
"0dB."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:37
msgid ""
"Every 3dB below the 0dB limit, sound energy is *halved*. It means the "
"sound volume at -3dB is half as loud as 0dB. -6dB is half as loud as -3dB"
" and so on."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:38
msgid ""
"When working with decibels, sound is considered no longer audible between"
" -60dB and -80dB. This makes your working range generally between -60dB "
"and 0dB."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:40
msgid ""
"This can take a bit getting used to, but it's friendlier in the end and "
"will allow you to communicate better with audio professionals."

msgid "Audio buses can be found in the bottom panel of Godot Editor:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An *Audio Bus* bus (often called \"Audio Channels\" too) is a device "
"where audio is channeled. Audio data passes through it and can be "
"*modified* and *re-routed*. A VU-Meter (the bars that go up and down when"
" sound is played) can measure the loudness of the sound in Decibel scale."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:51
msgid ""
"The leftmost bus is the *Master Bus*. This bus outputs the mix to your "
"speakers so, as mentioned in the item above (Decibel Scale), make sure "
"that your mix rarely or never goes above 0dB in this bus. The rest of the"
" audio buses are used for *routing*. This means that, after modifying the"
" sound, they must send it to another bus to the left. Routing is always "
"from right to left without exception as this avoids creating infinite "
"routing loops!"

"Audio buses can contain all sorts of effects. These effects modify the "

msgid "Amplify"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:82
msgid ""
"It's the most basic effect. It changes the sound volume. Amplifying too "

msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:85
msgid "BandLimit and BandPass"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:87
msgid ""
"These are resonant filters which block frequencies around the *Cutoff* "

msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:90
msgid "Chorus"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:92
msgid ""
"This effect adds extra voices, detuned by LFO and with a small delay, to "

msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:95
msgid "Compressor"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:97
msgid ""
"The aim of a dynamic range compressor is to reduce the level of the sound"
" when the amplitude goes over a certain threshold in Decibels. One of the"
" main uses of a compressor is to increase the dynamic range while "
"clipping the least possible (when sound goes over 0dB)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:100
msgid ""
"Compressor has may uses in the mix, for example: * It can be used in the "
"Master bus to compress the whole output (Although a Limiter is probably "
"better) * It can be used in voice channels to ensure they sound as even "
"as possible. * It can be *Sidechained*. This means, it can reduce the "
"sound level using another audio bus for threshold detection. This "
"technique is very common in video game mixing to download the level of "
"Music/SFX while voices are being heard. * It can accentuate transients by"
" using a bit wider attack, meaning it can make sound effects sound more "
"punchy."

#: ../../tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:107

"There is a lot of bibliography written about compressors, and Godot "

msgid "Distortion"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:117

"Adds classical effects to modify the sound and make it dirty. Godot "

msgid ""
"Godot provides three model of equalizers with different band counts. "
"Equalizers are very useful on the Master Bus to completely master a mix "
"and give it character. They are also very useful when a game is run on a "
"mobile device, to adjust the mix to that kind of speakers (it can be "
"added but disabled when headphones are plugged)."
msgstr ""

msgid "HighPassFilter, HighShelfFilter"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:129
msgid ""
"These are filters that cut frequencies below a specific *Cutoff*. A "
"common use of high pass filters is to add it to effects (or voice) that "
"were recorded too close too a mic and need to sound more realistic. It is"
" commonly used for some types of environment like space."
msgstr ""

msgid "Limiter"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:135
msgid ""
"A limiter is similar to a compressor, but it's less flexible and designed"
" to disallow sound going over a given dB threshold. Adding one in the "
"*Master Bus* is always recommended to reduce the effects of clipping."

msgid "LowPassFilter, LowShelfFilter"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:141
msgid ""
"These are the most common filters, they cut frequencies above a specific "

msgid ""
"It probably does not make much sense to explain that this effect is "

"This effect allows for modulating pitch independently of tempo. All "

"There is no need to disable buses manually when not in use, Godot detects"

msgid "Bus Rearrangement"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:186
msgid ""
"Stream Players use bus names to identify a bus, which allows adding, "
"removing and moving buses around while the reference to them is kept. If "
"a bus is renamed, however, the reference will be lost and the Stream "
"Player will output to Master. This system was chosen because rearranging "
"buses is a more common process than renaming them."
