"In most games it is desirable to, at some point, interrupt the game to do"
" something else, such as taking a break or changing options. However this"
" is not as simple as it seems. The game might be stopped, but it might be"
" desirable that some menus and animations continue working."

"Implementing a fine-grained control for what can be paused (and what can "

"To set pause mode, the pause state must be set. This is done by assigning"

"Before enabling pause, make sure that nodes that must keep working during"
" pause are white-listed. This is done by editing the \"Pause Mode\" "
"property in a node:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/misc/pausing_games.rst:49
msgid ""
"By default all nodes have this property in the \"Inherit\" state. This "
"means, that they will only process (or not) depending on what this same "
"property is set on the parent node. If the parent is set to \"Inherit\" ,"
" then the grandparent will be checked and so on. Ultimately, if a state "
"can't be found in any of the grandparents, the pause state in SceneTree "
"is used. This means that, by default, when the game is paused every node "
"will be paused."
