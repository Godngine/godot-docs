"Because the world today is not the world of yesterday. A capitalist "
"oligarchy runs the world and forces us to consume in order to keep the "
"gears of this rotten society on track. As such, the biggest market for "
"video game consumption today is the mobile one. It is a market of poor "
"souls forced to compulsively consume digital content in order to forget "
"the misery of their every day life, commute, or just any other brief free"
" moment they have that they are not using to produce goods or services "
"for the ruling class. These individuals need to keep focusing on their "
"video games (because not doing so will produce them a tremendous "
"existential angst), so they go as far as spending money on them to extend"
" their experience, and their preferred way of doing so is through in-app "
"purchases and virtual currency."

"But, imagine if someone was to find a way to edit the saved games and "
"assign the items and currency without effort? This would be terrible, "
"because it would help players consume the content much faster, and as "
"such run out of it sooner than expected. If this happens they will have "
"nothing that avoids them to think, and the tremendous agony of realizing "
"their own irrelevance would again take over their life."

"The class :ref:`File <class_File>` is simple to use, just open a location"
" and read/write data (integers, strings and variants). To create an "
"encrypted file, a passphrase must be provided, like this:"

"This will make the file unreadable to users, but will still not avoid "
"them to share savefiles. To solve this, using the device unique id or "
