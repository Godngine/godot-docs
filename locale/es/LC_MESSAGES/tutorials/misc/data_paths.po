"For the sake of supporting as many platforms as possible, Godot only "
"accepts unix style path separators (``/``). These work everywhere, "
"including Windows."

"As mentioned before. Godot considers that a project exists at any given "
"folder that contains an \"project.godot\" text file, even if such file is"
" empty."

"Accessing project files can be done by opening any path with ``res://`` "
"as a base. For example, a texture located in the root of the project "
"folder may be opened from the following path: ``res://sometexture.png``."

"While the project is running, it is a very common scenario that the "
"resource path will be read-only, due to it being inside a package, self "
"contained executable, or system wide install location."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/misc/data_paths.rst:33
msgid ""
"Storing persistent files in such scenarios should be done by using the "
"``user://`` prefix, for example: ``user://gamesave.txt``."

msgid ""
"In some devices (for example, mobile ad consoles) this path is unique for"
" the app. Under desktop operating systems, the engine uses the typical "
"``~/.local/share/godot/app_userdata/Name`` (check the project name under "
"the settings) in macOS and Linux, and ``APPDATA/Name`` for Windows."
