"Previously, importing assets in Godot 2.x required manual maintenance of "
"a separate directory with source assets. Without doing this, it was "
"impossible to specify how to convert and change import flags for "
"textures, audios, scenes, etc."

msgid ""
"In Godot 3.0, we use a more modern approach to importing: Simply drop "
"your assets (image files, scenes, audios, fonts, etc) directly in the "
"project folder (copy them manually with your OS file exporer). Godot will"
" automatically import these files internally and keep the imported "
"resources hidden in a res://.import folder."

"Changing the import parameters of an asset in Godot (again, keep in mind "
"import parameters are only present in non-native Godot resource types) is"
" easy. Just select in the filesystem dock the relevant resource:"

"And, after adjusting the parameters, just press \"Reimport\". The "
"parameters used will be only for this asset and will be used on future "
"reimports."

"Changing import parameters of several assets at the same time is also "
