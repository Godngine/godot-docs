"The world is full of different markets and cultures and, to maximize "
"profits™, nowadays games are released in several languages. To solve "
"this, internationalized text must be supported in any modern game engine."

msgid ""
"In regular desktop or mobile applications, internationalized text is "
"usually located in resource files (or .po files for GNU stuff). Games, "
"however, can use several orders of magnitude more text than applications,"
" so they must support efficient methods for dealing with loads of "
"multilingual text."

msgid ""
"There are two approaches to generate multilingual language games and "
"applications. Both are based on a key:value system. The first is to use "
"one of the languages as the key (usually English), the second is to use a"
" specific identifier. The first approach is probably easier for "
"development if a game is released first in English, later in other "
"languages, but a complete nightmare if working with many languages at the"
" same time."

msgid ""
"In general, games use the second approach and a unique ID is used for "
"each string. This allows you to revise the text while it is being "
"translated to other languages. The unique ID can be a number, a string, "
"or a string with a number (it's just a unique string anyway)."

"To complete the picture and allow efficient support for translations, "
"Godot has a special importer that can read CSV files. All spreadsheet "
"editors (be it Libreoffice, Microsoft Office, Google Docs, etc.) can "
"export to this format, so the only requirement is that the files have a "
"special arrangement. The CSV files must be saved in UTF-8 encoding and be"
" formatted as follows:"
