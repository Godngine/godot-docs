"Each has different advantages. * Wav files use raw data or light "
"compression, requre small amount of CPU to play back (hundreds of "
"simultaneous voices in this format are fine), but take up significant "
"space. * Ogg Vorbis files use a stronger compression that results in much"
" smaller file size, but uses significantly more processor to play back."
