"Imagine for a second that you are not a game developer anymore. Instead, "
"you're a chef! Change your hipster outfit for a toque and a double "
"breasted jacket. Now, instead of making games, you create new and "
"delicious recipes for your guests."

msgid ""
"So, how does a chef create a recipe? Recipes are divided into two "
"sections: the first is the ingredients and the second is the instructions"

"Making games in Godot feels pretty much the same way. Using the engine "
"feels like being in a kitchen. In this kitchen, *nodes* are like a "
"refrigerator full of fresh ingredients with which to cook."

"There are many types of nodes. Some show images, others play sound, other"

"But let's start with the basics. Nodes are fundamental building blocks "
"for creating a game. As mentioned above, a node can perform a variety of "
"specialized functions. However, any given node always has the following "
"attributes:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started/step_by_step/scenes_and_nodes.rst:35

msgid "It can be added to other nodes as children."
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started/step_by_step/scenes_and_nodes.rst:43
msgid ""
"The last one is very important. Nodes can have other nodes as children. "
"When arranged in this way, the nodes become a **tree**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started/step_by_step/scenes_and_nodes.rst:46
msgid ""
"In Godot, the ability to arrange nodes in this way creates a powerful "
"tool for organizing projects. Since different nodes have different "
"functions, combining them allows for the creation of more complex "
"functions."

msgid ""
"Don't worry if this doesn't click yet. We will continue to explore this "

"A scene is composed of a group of nodes organized hierarchically (in tree"

"Running a game means running a scene. A project can contain several "

"Basically, the Godot editor is a **scene editor**. It has plenty of tools"
" for editing 2D and 3D scenes as well as user interfaces, but the editor "
