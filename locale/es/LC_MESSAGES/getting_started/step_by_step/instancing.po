"Creating a single scene and adding nodes into it might work for small "
"projects, but as a project grows in size and complexity, the number of "
"nodes can quickly become unmanageable. To address this, Godot allows a "
"project to be separated into any number scenes. This provides you with a "
"powerful tool to organize the different components of your game."
