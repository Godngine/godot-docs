"In previous tutorials, everything revolved around the concept of nodes. "
"Scenes are simply a collection of nodes. They become active once they "
"enter the *scene tree*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started/step_by_step/scene_tree.rst:16
msgid ""
"This concept deserves going into a little more detail. In fact, the scene"
" system is not even a core component of Godot, as it is possible to skip "
"it and write a script (or C++ code) that talks directly to the servers. "
"But making a game that way would be a lot of work."

#: ../../getting_started/step_by_step/scene_tree.rst:24
msgid ""
"The way Godot works internally is as follows. There is the :ref:`OS "
"<class_OS>` class, which is the only instance that runs at the beginning."
" Afterwards, all drivers, servers, scripting languages, scene system, etc"
" are loaded."
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started/step_by_step/scene_tree.rst:29
msgid ""
"When initialization is complete, :ref:`OS <class_OS>` needs to be "
"supplied a :ref:`MainLoop <class_MainLoop>` to run. Up to this point, all"
" this is internals working (you can check main/main.cpp file in the "
"source code if you are ever interested to see how this works internally)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started/step_by_step/scene_tree.rst:35
msgid ""
"The user program, or game, starts in the MainLoop. This class has a few "
"methods, for initialization, idle (frame-synchronized callback), fixed "
"(physics-synchronized callback), and input. Again, this is really low "
"level and when making games in Godot, writing your own MainLoop does not "
"even make sense."
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started/step_by_step/scene_tree.rst:44
msgid ""
"One of the ways to explain how Godot works, is that it's a high level "
"game engine over a low level middleware."
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started/step_by_step/scene_tree.rst:47
msgid ""
"The scene system is the game engine, while the :ref:`OS <class_OS>` and "
"servers are the low level API."
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started/step_by_step/scene_tree.rst:50
msgid ""
"In any case, the scene system provides its own main loop to OS, "
":ref:`SceneTree <class_SceneTree>`. This is automatically instanced and "
"set when running a scene, no need to do any extra work."
msgstr ""

"It's important to know that this class exists because it has a few "
"important uses:"

msgid ""
"It contains the root :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>`, to which a scene "
"is added as a child when it's first opened, to become part of the *Scene "
"Tree* (more on that next)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started/step_by_step/scene_tree.rst:61

"It contains information about the groups, and has means to call all nodes"
" in a group, or get a list of them."
msgstr ""

"It contains some global state functionality, such as setting pause mode, "

"When a node is part of the Scene Tree, the :ref:`SceneTree "
"<class_SceneTree>` singleton can be obtained by simply calling "
":ref:`Node.get_tree() <class_Node_get_tree>`."

"The root :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>` is always at the top of the "
"scene. From a node, it can be obtained in two different ways:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started/step_by_step/scene_tree.rst:83
msgid ""
"This node contains the main viewport, anything that is a child of a "
":ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>` is drawn inside of it by default, so it "
"makes sense that the top of all nodes is always a node of this type, "
"otherwise nothing would be seen!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started/step_by_step/scene_tree.rst:88

"While other viewports can be created in the scene (for split-screen "
"effects and such), this one is the only one that is never created by the "

"When nodes enter the *Scene Tree*, they become active. They get access to"

"This is a quick and useful way to switch scenes, but has the drawback "
