"File systems are yet another hot topic in engine development. The file "
"system manages how the assets are stored, and how they are accessed. A "
"well designed file system also allows multiple developers to edit the "
"same source files and assets while collaborating together."

"Initial versions of the Godot engine (and previous iterations before it "
"was named Godot) used a database. Assets were stored in it and assigned "
"an ID. Other approaches were tried as well, such as local databases, "
"files with metadata, etc. In the end the simple approach won and now "
"Godot stores all assets as files in the file system."

"The file system stores resources on disk. Anything, from a script, to a "
"scene or a PNG image is a resource to the engine. If a resource contains "
"properties that reference other resources on disk, the paths to those "
"resources are also included. If a resource has sub-resources that are "
"built-in, the resource is saved in a single file together with all the "
"bundled sub-resources. For example, a font resource is often bundled "
"together with the font textures."

"In general the Godot file system avoids using metadata files. The reason "
"for this is simple, existing asset managers and VCSs are simply much "
"better than anything we can implement, so Godot tries the best to play "
"along with SVN, Git, Mercurial, Perforce, etc."

"The project.godot file is the project description file, and it is always "

"Godot only supports ``/`` as a path delimiter. This is done for "
"portability reasons. All operating systems support this, even Windows, so"

"When accessing resources, using the host OS file system layout can be "

"``res://`` was created."
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started/step_by_step/filesystem.rst:71

"The path ``res://`` will always point at the project root (where "

"This file system is read-write only when running the project locally from"

"phones or consoles, or running from DVD), the file system will become "

"Writing to disk is often still needed for various tasks such as saving "

"Alternatively host file system paths can also be used, but this is not "
"recommended for a released product as these paths are not guaranteed to "
"work on all platforms. However, using host file system paths can be very "
"useful when writing development tools in Godot!"

msgid ""
"There are some drawbacks to this simple file system design. The first "
"issue is that moving assets around (renaming them or moving them from one"
" path to another inside the project) will break existing references to "
"these assets. These references will have to be re-defined to point at the"
" new asset location."
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started/step_by_step/filesystem.rst:103
msgid ""
"To avoid this, do all your move, delete and rename operations from within"
" Godot, on the FileSystem dock. Never move assets from outside Godot, or "
"dependencies will have to be fixed manually (Godot detects this and helps"
" you fix them anyway, but why going the hardest route?)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started/step_by_step/filesystem.rst:108
msgid ""
"The second is that under Windows and macOS file and path names are case "
"insensitive. If a developer working in a case insensitive host file "
"system saves an asset as \"myfile.PNG\", but then references it as "
"\"myfile.png\", it will work just fine on their platorm, but not on other"
" platforms, such as Linux, Android, etc. This may also apply to exported "
"binaries, which use a compressed package to store all files."
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started/step_by_step/filesystem.rst:114
msgid ""
"It is recommended that your team clearly defines a naming convention for "
"files when working with Godot! One simple fool-proof convention is to "
"only allow lowercase file and path names."
