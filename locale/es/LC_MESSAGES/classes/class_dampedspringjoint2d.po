":ref:`float<class_float>` **damping** - The spring joint's damping ratio."
" A value between ``0`` and ``1``. When the two bodies move into different"
" directions the system tries to align them to the spring axis again. A "
"high ``damping`` value forces the attached bodies to align faster. "
"Default value: ``1``"

":ref:`float<class_float>` **length** - The spring joint's maximum length."
" The two attached bodies cannot stretch it past this value. Default "
"value: ``50``"

msgid ""
":ref:`float<class_float>` **rest_length** - When the bodies attached to "
"the spring joint move they stretch or squash it. The joint always tries "
"to resize towards this length. Default value: ``0``"
msgstr ""

#: ../../classes/class_dampedspringjoint2d.rst:36
msgid ""
":ref:`float<class_float>` **stiffness** - The higher the value, the less "
"the bodies attached to the joint will deform it. The joint applies an "
"opposing force to the bodies, the product of the stiffness multiplied by "
"the size difference from its resting length. Default value: ``20``"
