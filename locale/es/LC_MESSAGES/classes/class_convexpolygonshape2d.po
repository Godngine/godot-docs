"Convex Polygon Shape for 2D physics. A convex polygon, whatever its "
"shape, is internally decomposed into as many convex polygons as needed to"
" ensure all collision checks against it are always done on convex "
"polygons (which are faster to check)."

"The main difference between a ``ConvexPolygonShape2D`` and a "
":ref:`ConcavePolygonShape2D<class_concavepolygonshape2d>` is that a "
"concave polygon assumes it is concave and uses a more complex method of "
"collision detection, and a convex one forces itself to be convex in order"
" to speed up collision detection."
