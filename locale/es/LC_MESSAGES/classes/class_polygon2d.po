":ref:`bool<class_bool>` **antialiased** - If ``true`` polygon edges will "

msgid ""
":ref:`Color<class_color>` **color** - The polygon's fill color. If "
"``texture`` is defined, it will be multiplied by this color. It will also"
" be the default color for vertices not set in ``vertex_colors``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../classes/class_polygon2d.rst:32
msgid ""
":ref:`float<class_float>` **invert_border** - Added padding applied to "
"the bounding box when using ``invert``. Setting this value too small may "
"result in a \"Bad Polygon\" error. Default value: ``100``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../classes/class_polygon2d.rst:36
msgid ""
":ref:`bool<class_bool>` **invert_enable** - If ``true`` polygon will be "
"inverted, containing the area outside the defined points and extending to"
" the ``invert_border``. Default value: ``false``."

":ref:`Vector2<class_vector2>` **texture_offset** - Amount to offset the "

":ref:`PoolVector2Array<class_poolvector2array>` **uv** - Texture "

"A Polygon2D is defined by a set of points. Each point is connected to the"
