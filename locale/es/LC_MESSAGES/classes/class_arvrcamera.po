"This is a helper spatial node for our camera, note that if stereoscopic "
"rendering is applicable (VR-HMD) most of the camera properties are "
"ignored as the HMD information overrides them. The only properties that "
"can be trusted are the near and far planes."

"The position and orientation of this node is automatically updated by the"
" ARVR Server to represent the location of the HMD if such tracking is "
"available and can thus be used by game logic. Note that in contrast to "
"the ARVR Controller the render thread has access to the most up to date "
"tracking data of the HMD and the location of the ARVRCamera can lag a few"
" milliseconds behind what is used for rendering as a result."
