"MeshInstance is a node that takes a :ref:`Mesh<class_mesh>` resource and "
"adds it to the current scenario by creating an instance of it. This is "
"the class most often used to get 3D geometry rendered and can be used to "
"instance a single :ref:`Mesh<class_mesh>` in many places. This allows to "
"reuse geometry and save on resources. When a :ref:`Mesh<class_mesh>` has "
"to be instanced more than thousands of times at close proximity, consider"
" using a :ref:`MultiMesh<class_multimesh>` in a "
":ref:`MultiMeshInstance<class_multimeshinstance>` instead."
