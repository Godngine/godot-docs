"Editor facility for creating and editing collision shapes in 2D space. "
"You can use this node to represent all sorts of collision shapes, for "
"example, add this to an :ref:`Area2D<class_area2d>` to give it a "
"detection shape, or add it to a :ref:`PhysicsBody2D<class_physicsbody2d>`"
" to give create solid object. **IMPORTANT**: this is an Editor-only "
"helper to create shapes, use "
":ref:`get_shape<class_CollisionShape2D_get_shape>` to get the actual "
"shape."
