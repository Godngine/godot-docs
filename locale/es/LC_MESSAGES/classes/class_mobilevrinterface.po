":ref:`float<class_float>` **k1** - The k1 lens factor is one of the two "

":ref:`float<class_float>` **oversample** - The oversample setting. "
"Because of the lens distortion we have to render our buffers at a higher "
"resolution then the screen can natively handle. A value between 1.5 and "
"2.0 often provides good results but at the cost of performance."

"This is a generic mobile VR implementation where you need to provide "
"details about the phone and HMD used. It does not rely on any existing "
"framework. This is the most basic interface we have. For the best effect "
"you do need a mobile phone with a gyroscope and accelerometer."

"Note that even though there is no positional tracking the camera will "
