":ref:`bool<class_bool>` **cubic_interp** - If ``true`` the position "
"between two cached points is interpolated cubically, and linearly "
"otherwise."
msgstr ""

#: ../../classes/class_pathfollow.rst:26
msgid ""
"The points along the :ref:`Curve3D<class_curve3d>` of the "
":ref:`Path<class_path>` are precomputed before use, for faster "
"calculations. The point at the requested offset is then calculated "
"interpolating between two adjacent cached points. This may present a "
"problem if the curve makes sharp turns, as the cached points may not "
"follow the curve closely enough."
msgstr ""

#: ../../classes/class_pathfollow.rst:28
msgid ""
"There are two answers to this problem: Either increase the number of "
"cached points and increase memory consumption, or make a cubic "
"interpolation between two points at the cost of (slightly) slower "
"calculations."

":ref:`bool<class_bool>` **loop** - If ``true``, any offset outside the "
"path's length will wrap around, instead of stopping at the ends. Use it "
"for cyclic paths."

":ref:`float<class_float>` **offset** - The distance from the first "

msgid ""
":ref:`float<class_float>` **unit_offset** - The distance from the first "
"vertex, considering 0.0 as the first vertex and 1.0 as the last. This is "
"just another way of expressing the offset within the path, as the offset "
"supplied is multiplied internally by the path's length."

"It is useful for making other nodes follow a path, without coding the "
"movement pattern. For that, the nodes must be descendants of this node. "
"Then, when setting an offset in this node, the descendant nodes will move"
" accordingly."
