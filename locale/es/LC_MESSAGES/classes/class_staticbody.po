"Static body for 3D Physics. A static body is a simple body that is not "
"intended to move. They don't consume any CPU resources in contrast to a "
"RigidBody3D so they are great for scenario collision."

"A static body can also be animated by using simulated motion mode. This "
"is useful for implementing functionalities such as moving platforms. When"
" this mode is active the body can be animated and automatically computes "
"linear and angular velocity to apply in that frame and to influence other"
" bodies."

"Alternatively, a constant linear or angular velocity can be set for the "
"static body, so even if it doesn't move, it affects other bodies as if it"
" was moving (this is useful for simulating conveyor belts or conveyor "
"wheels)."
