"Turning on the option **Load As Placeholder** for an instanced scene in "
"the editor causes it to be replaced by an InstacePlaceholder when running"
" the game. This makes it possible to delay actually loading the scene "
"until calling "
":ref:`replace_by_instance<class_InstancePlaceholder_replace_by_instance>`."
" This is useful to avoid loading large scenes all at once by loading "
"parts of it selectively."

"The InstancePlaceholder does not have a transform. This causes any child "
"nodes to be positioned relatively to the Viewport from point (0,0), "
"rather than their parent as displayed in the editor. Replacing the "
"placeholder with a scene with a transform will transform children "
"relatively to their parent again."
