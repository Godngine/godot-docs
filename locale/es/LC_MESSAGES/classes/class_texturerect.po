"Use TextureRect to draw icons and sprites in your User Interfaces. To "
"create panels and menu boxes, take a look at NinePatchFrame. Its Stretch "
"Mode property controls the texture's scale and placement. It can scale, "
"tile and stay centered inside its bounding rectangle. TextureRect is one "
"of the 5 most common nodes to create game UI."
