"Uses a :ref:`Gradient<class_gradient>` to fill the texture data, the "
"gradient will be filled from left to right using colors obtained from the"
" gradient, this means that the texture does not necessarily represent an "
"exact copy of the gradient, but instead an interpolation of samples "
"obtained from the gradient at fixed steps (see "
":ref:`set_width<class_GradientTexture_set_width>`)."
