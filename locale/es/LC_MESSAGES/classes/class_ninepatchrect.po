"Better known as 9-slice panels, NinePatchRect produces clean panels of "
"any size, based on a small texture. To do so, it splits the texture in a "
"3 by 3 grid. When you scale the node, it tiles the texture's sides "
"horizontally or vertically, the center on both axes but it doesn't scale "
"or tile the corners."
