"The points along the :ref:`Curve2D<class_curve2d>` of the "
":ref:`Path2D<class_path2d>` are precomputed before use, for faster "
"calculations. The point at the requested offset is then calculated "
"interpolating between two adjacent cached points. This may present a "
"problem if the curve makes sharp turns, as the cached points may not "
"follow the curve closely enough."

"There are two answers to this problem: Either increase the number of "
"cached points and increase memory consumption, or make a cubic "
