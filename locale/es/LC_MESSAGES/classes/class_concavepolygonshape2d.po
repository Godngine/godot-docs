"Concave polygon 2D shape resource for physics. It is made out of segments"
" and is very optimal for complex polygonal concave collisions. It is "
"really not advised to use for :ref:`RigidBody2D<class_rigidbody2d>` "
"nodes. A CollisionPolygon2D in convex decomposition mode (solids) or "
"several convex objects are advised for that instead. Otherwise, a concave"
" polygon 2D shape is better for static collisions."

"The main difference between a "
":ref:`ConvexPolygonShape2D<class_convexpolygonshape2d>` and a "
"``ConcavePolygonShape2D`` is that a concave polygon assumes it is concave"
" and uses a more complex method of collision detection, and a convex one "
"forces itself to be convex in order to speed up collision detection."
