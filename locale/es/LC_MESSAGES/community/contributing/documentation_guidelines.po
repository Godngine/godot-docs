"Creating or modifying documentation pages is mainly done via the `godot-"
"docs GitHub repository <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs>`_. The"
" HTML (or PDF and EPUB) documentation is generated from the .rst files "
"(reStructuredText markup language) in that repository. Modifying those "
"pages in a pull request and getting it merged will trigger a rebuild of "
"the online documentation."

"For details on Git usage and the pull request workflow, please refer to "
"the :ref:`doc_pr_workflow` page. Most of what it describes regarding the "

"If you want to edit the **API reference**, please note that it should "
"*not* be done in the godot-docs repository. Instead, you should edit the "
"``doc/classes/*`` XML files of Godot's main repository. These files are "
"then later used to generate the in-editor documentation as well as the "
"API reference of the online docs."
