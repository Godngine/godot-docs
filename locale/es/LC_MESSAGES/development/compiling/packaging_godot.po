"Per default, Godot stores all settings and installed templates in a per-"
"user directory. First Godot checks the ``APPDATA`` environment variable. "
"If it exists, the per-user directory is the \"Godot\" subdirectory of "
"``$APPDATA``. If ``APPDATA`` doesn't exist, Godot checks the ``HOME`` "
"environment variable. The per-user directory is then the \".godot\" "
"subdir of ``$HOME``."
