"All audio resources require two audio based classes: AudioStream and "
"AudioStreamPlayback. As a data container, AudioStream contains the "
"resource and exposes itself to GDScript. AudioStream references its own "
"internal custom AudioStreamPlayback which translates AudioStream into PCM"
" data."

"An AudioStream consists of three components: data container, stream name,"
" and an AudioStreamPlayback friend class generator. Audio data can be "
"loaded in a number of ways such as with an internal counter for a tone "
"generator, internal/external buffer, or a file reference."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some AudioStreams need to be stateless such as objects loaded from "
"ResourceLoader. ResourceLoader loads once and references the same object "
"regardless how many times ``load`` is called on a specific resource. "
"Therefore, playback state must be self contained in AudioStreamPlayback."

"AudioStreamPlayer uses ``mix`` callback to obtain PCM data. The callback "

"Godotâ€™s AudioServer currently uses 44100 Hz sample rate. When other "

"AudioStreamPlaybackResampled. Godot provides cubic interpolation for "
"audio resampling."

"Instead of overloading ``mix``, AudioStreamPlaybackResampled uses "
