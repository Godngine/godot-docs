Now you have a fully working single player FPS!

At this point you have a good base to build more complicated FPS games.

.. warning:: If you ever get lost, be sure to read over the code again!

             You can download the finished project for the entire tutorial **here**
             
             TODO: Add the finished project for part 5!

.. tip:: The finished project source is hosted on Github as well: https://github.com/TwistedTwigleg/Godot_FPS_Tutorial
         
         **Please note that the code in Github may or may not be in sync with the tutorial on the documentation**.
         
         The code in the documentation is likely better managed and/or more up to date.
         If you are unsure on which to use, use the project(s) provided in the documentation.

You can download all of the ``.blend`` files used in this tutorial here: :download:`Godot_FPS_BlenderFiles.zip <files/Godot_FPS_BlenderFiles.zip>`

.. error:: TODO: update the blender files!

.. note:: The finished project source files contain the same exact code, just written in a different order.
          This is because the finished project source files are what the tutorial is based on.

          The finished project code was written in the order that features were created, not necessarily
          in a order that is ideal for learning.

          Other than that, the source is exactly the same, just with helpful comments explaining what
          each part does.
