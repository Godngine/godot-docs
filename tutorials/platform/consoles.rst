Console Support in Godot
========================

Official Support
----------------

Godot does not officially support consoles (save for XBox One via UWP) currently.

The reasons for this are:

* To develop for consoles, one must be licensed as a company. Godot, as an open source project, does not have such a legal figure. 
* Console SDKs are secret, and protected by non-disclosure agreements. Even if we could get access to them, we could not publish the code as open-source.
* Consoles require specialized hardware to develop for, so regular individuals can't create games for them anyway.

This, however, does not mean you can't port your games to consoles. Quite the contrary.

Third-Party Support
--------------------

Console ports of Godot are offered via third party companies (which have
ported Godot on their own) and offer porting and publishing services of
your games to consoles.

Following is the list of providers:

* `Lone Wolf Technology <http://www.lonewolftechnology.com/>`_ offers
  Switch, PS4 and XBox One porting and publishing of Godot games.
