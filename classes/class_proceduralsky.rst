Description
-----------

ProceduralSky provides a way to create an effective background quickly by defining procedural parameters for the sun, the sky and the ground. The sky and ground are very similar, they are defined by a color at the horizon, another color, and finally an easing curve to interpolate between these two colors. Similarly the sun is described by a position in the sky, a color, and an easing curve. However, the sun also defines a minimum and maximum angle, these two values define at what distance the easing curve begins and ends from the sun, and thus end up defining the size of the sun in the sky.

The ProceduralSky is updated on the CPU after the parameters change and stored in a texture and then displayed as a background in the scene. This makes it relatively unsuitable for realtime updates during gameplay. But with a small texture size it is still feasible to update relatively frequently becuase it is updated on a background thread when multi-threading is available.
