Introduction
------------

C# is a high-level,  programming language developed by Microsoft. It is 
implemented in Godot with the Mono 5.2 .NET framework, and has support for C# 7.0.   

.. note:: This is **not** a full-scale tutorial on the C# language as a whole.
        If you aren't already familiar with its syntax or features,
        see the `Microsoft C# guide<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/index>`_

Necessary Downloads
-------------------

To use C# in Godot you must have `Mono<http://www.mono-project.com/download/>`_
installed(at least version 5.2), and use the 
Mono version of Godot.(You can still use GDScript and VisualScript in this version).
Windows users also need MS Build 15.0, which comes bundled with Visual Studio 2017,
or can be downloaded separately with `build tools for Visual Studio 2017<https://www.visualstudio.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=15#>`_.


History
-------

Back in 2016, the Godot team reached out to Microsoft, with Miguel de Icaza's 
support, to see if they would consider funding C# support being added to 
Godot. Microsoft agreed and gave the team a $24,000 donation to work on adding
C# support. Thanks to that donation, Juan Lineietsky and Ignacio Rold√°n 
Etcheverry were able to work on bringing C# support to Godot using the Mono 
.NET framework. Support was added to version 3.0 using mono 5.2, giving users 
the power of C# in their game making process.

Example
-------

Here's a blank C# script with some comments to demonstate how one works. 

::
    using Godot;
    using System;

    public class Path : Path
    {
        // Member variables here, example:
        private int a = 2;
        private string b = "textvar";

        public override void _Ready()
        {
            // Called every time the node is added to the scene.
            // Initialization here
            
        }

        public override void _Process(float delta)
        {
            // Called every frame. Delta is time since last frame.
            // Update game logic here.
            
        }
    }


Configuring an external editor
-----------------------------

While Godot does have its own scripting editor, its support for C# is kept
minimal, and it's reccomended that you use an external IDE or editor, such as
Microsoft Visual Studio Code, or MonoDevelop, which provide auto-completion,
debugging and other features useful when working with C#.
To set it up, in Godot click on ``Editor``, then ``Editor Settings``. Scroll 
down to the bottom, to the ``Mono`` settings. Under Mono click on ``Editor``,
and on that page choose your external editor of choice.
