About the Asset Library
=======================

The Godot Asset Library, otherwise known as the AssetLib, is a repository of
user-submitted Godot addons, scripts and other resources, collectively referred
to as assets, available for all Godot users for download and use in their own
Godot projects. It is available on the `Godot website <http://godotengine.org/asset-library>`_,
and is also accessible directly from within the engine's editor interface.

While on the surface the Asset Library might look and function similar to asset
stores available for other engines (such as Unity's Asset Store, or Unreal
Engine's Marketplace), in practice it is a lot more similar to GNU Emacs' ELPA,
or Mozilla Firefox's Add-ons repository - the AssetLib does not support selling
paid assets (though in the future, a third-party asset store that allows this
might surface), and while not technically enforced, users are encouraged to 
distribute their assets under a free and open-source license, such as the MIT 
license (the same kind of license that the Godot Engine itself is licensed as),
or the GPL.
